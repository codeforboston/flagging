<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        CRWA's Flagging Program uses a system of color-coded flags to indicate whether or not the river's water quality is
        safe for boating at eleven boating locations between Watertown and Boston. Flag colors are based on E. coli and
        cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) levels:
    </p>
    <ul class="flag-explanation">
        <li><font color="navy">Blue</font> flags indicate suitable boating conditions.
        <li><font color="darkred">Red</font> flags indicate potential health risks. Consider avoiding areas where red flags are posted or make sure you wash after boating nearby.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        CRWA estimates E. coli bacteria levels using models that take into account a variety of environmental factors
        including rainfall and river flow. CRWA collects water samples weekly to verify the model forecasts. Cyanobacteria
        monitoring is conducted every 1-2 weeks.
